# DFNGenerator has now been changed to DFMGenerator (https://github.com/JointFlow/DFMGenerator)
Project Link: [https://github.com/JointFlow/DFMGenerator](https://github.com/JointFlow/DFMGenerator)

Please note that DFN Generator has now been renamed to Dynamic Fracture Model Generator (DFM Generator). This reflects the fact that the software generates implicit fracture models and continuum fracture property data (e.g. P30 and P32 fracture density, fracture porosity, mean fracture length, connectivity and anisotropy indices etc.) data as well as explicit DFNs.

Future releases will be made on the DFMGenerator repository (https://github.com/JointFlow/DFMGenerator).
